# Attendance-system-using-face-recognition
Daily attendance marking is a common and important activity in schools and colleges for checking the performance of students. Manual Attendance maintaining is difficult process, especially for large group of students. Some automated systems developed to overcome these difficulties, have drawbacks like cost, fake attendance, accuracy, intrusiveness. To overcome these drawbacks, there is need of smart and automated attendance system. Traditional face recognition systems employ methods to identify a face from the given input but the results are not usually accurate and precise as desired. The system described in this we aims to deviate from such traditional systems and introduce a new approach to identify a student using a face recognition system, the generation of a facial Model. This describes the working of the face recognition system that will be deployed as an Automated Attendance System in a classroom environment.
